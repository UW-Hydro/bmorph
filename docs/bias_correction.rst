Bias Correction **(IN PROGRESS)**
=================================

This page documents the implementation of
**bmorph** bias correction for streamflow
data in a watershed. An example workflow notebook
can be found in *example_notebooks*.

bmorph Usage
-------------------
Independent Bias Correction: Univariate (IBC_U)

Independent Bias Correction: Conditioned (IBC_C)

Spatially Consistent Bias Correction: Univariate (SCBC_U)

Spatially Consistent Bias Correction: Conditioned (SCBC_C)
