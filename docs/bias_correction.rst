Bias Correction **(IN PROGRESS)**
=================================

This page documents the implementation of
**bmorph** bias correction for streamflow
data in a watershed. An example workflow notebook
can be found in *example_notebooks*.

bmorph Overview
---------------
Independent Bias Correction: Univariate (IBC_U)
