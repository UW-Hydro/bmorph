    "# bmorph Tutorial: Getting your first bias corrections\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to setup data for and bias correct it through bmorph, it contains the same information as the [tutorial](bmorph_tutorial.rst) page.\n",
    "In this notebook, we will demonstrate how to perform four variations of bias correction. For more information about the details of each method refer to the [bias correction page](https://bmorph.readthedocs.io/en/latest/bias_correction.html) page. The rest of the documentation for bmorph can be found [here](https://bmorph.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).\n",

    "* Independent Bias Correction: Univariate (IBC_U) : IBC_U is the traditional bias correction method. This method can only be performed at sites with reference data.\n",
    "* Independent Bias Correction: Conditioned (IBC_C) : IBC_C allows for correcting for specific biases that are process-dependent. This method can only be performed at sites with reference data.\n",
    "* Spatially Consistent Bias Correction: Univariate (SCBC_U): SCBC_U corrects local flows at each river reach in the network, and then reroutes them to aggregate, producing bias corrected flows at locations of interest where reference data does and does not exist.\n",
    "* Spatially Consistent Bias Correction: Conditioned (SCBC_C): SCBC_C also corrects the local flows like SCBC_U, but allows for conditioning on dependent processes.\n",

    "With our necessary metadata defined let's make a couple of quick plots orienting you to the Yakima River Basin. To do so we will read in a network topology file, and shapefiles for the region. We will make one plot which has the Yakima River Basin, along with stream network, subbasins, and gauged sites labeled. We will also plot a network diagram which displays in an abstract sense how each stream segment is connected. For the latter we use the [SimpleRiverNetwork](https://bmorph.readthedocs.io/en/latest/srn.html) that we've implemented in bmorph. To set up the `SimpleRiverNetwork` we need the topology of the watershed (`yakima_topo`). The river network and shapefiles that we use to draw the map, and perform simulations on is the [Geospatial Fabric](        https://doi.org/10.5066/P971JAGF). In the Geospatial Fabric, rivers and streams are broken into segments, each with a unique identifier, as illustrated above in the `site_to_seg` definition.
